## CodeGen Templates

A codeGen Template is a directory with

* **Generate.properties** control file
* An Xml file listing the Velocity templates and there output names
* One or more Velocity templates

## Mdt Template

The MDT template is for Cobol copybooks where every logical field consists of
2 logical fields:

* A Mdt field that indicates if the Field is present
* The Data field

So in the *AAA-MDT* is the flag indicates if the **AAA** is present or not

~~~cobol
         20  AAA-MDT     PIC X(01).
         20  AAA         PIC X(03).
         20  BBB-MDT     PIC X(01).
         20  BBB         PIC X(03).
~~~

The *Mdt Template* generates a "field* for each logical field.
The above will generate


~~~java
    public IStringField getAAA() ...
    public IStringField getBBB()s ...
~~~

## Mdt Template principles

One of the principles is to keep the *Velocity Templates* as simple as possible and move as much
code as possible into support classes.
The Support code is in the [SupportJavaSource](SupportJavaSource) directory

## Support Code

Some important classes

## Generating using the RecordEditor

* Select the **Generate >>> Java JRecord code for Cobol** Option
* Select the Cobol copybook and click the **Generte JRecord Button**
* Enter the directory holding the template directories. So if directory structure is
**/MyTemplates/MdfTemplate** you would enter **MyTemplates** in this field and the **MdfTemplate** + any other Template directories
in the *MyTemplates* will be listed in the Template Combo box below it.
